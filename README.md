This is a monomer-dimer conversion model used for initial exploration of kinetics of dimer and monomer formation. This model numerically solves for a system of two ODEs and plots the solutions

This model is used a demonstration of data provided in Centromeres are Stress-Induced Fragile Sites (Kolbin et al.)

To utilize the code, run the cells sequentially. For testing out different values, simply change the corresponding value when calling the function.
